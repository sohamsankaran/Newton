Newton
=============

This is the code for Newton, a robot built by me (Soham Sankaran) and Rushabh Mashru for the WRO 2011 open category.

All code (except for anything present in the folder 'rethanksandarequest') written (in RobotC with some portions in Arduino C) by Soham Sankaran unless otherwise noted in the header of the document.
